# Spiral Knights Mobile - Guide Update

**IMPORTANT:** The previous installation guides for PojavLauncher on Android and iOS are now outdated and no longer fully functional.

I am excited to announce the development of a new, dedicated launcher designed to simplify playing **Spiral Knights** on mobile devices!

## Introducing KnightLauncher

KnightLauncher is a dedicated launcher that allows you to play **Spiral Knights**. It handles the downloading, installation, and execution of the game, offering a much improved experience over previous methods. While currently focused on Android, the vision is to provide a more streamlined cross-platform solution.

**Key Features:**

* **Dedicated Spiral Knights Experience:** Built specifically for Spiral Knights, handling its unique requirements.
* **Simplified Installation:** Manages the entire process of downloading, installing, and running the game.
* **OpenJDK Support:** Includes support for various OpenJDK versions (8, 11, 17, 21).
* **Virtual Controls:** Integrated virtual controls for touch-based gameplay.
* **Future Optimizations:** Work is ongoing for further optimization for touch screens.

KnightLauncher is built upon the foundations of [Amethyst](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android), leveraging their capabilities to create a tailored Spiral Knights experience.

**Where to find it:**
Please refer to the official KnightLauncher project page for the latest releases, download links, and installation instructions.
